# Word2Vec with CUDA C++
Word2Vec is widely known as a word embedding algorithm to generate distributed representations by means of a shallow neural network.  This implementation uses CUDA C++ as a hands-on forward and gradient calculations, with functionalities wirtten in plain kernel and with CUBLAS API routines.

# Files
Linking against CNPy, CURAND and CUBLAS libraries is required to compile the application.
